Add easy fancy-pants examples to your projects.

running:

  require 'lib/simple_example'
  include SimpleExample

  example do
    x = 1 + 1
    y = 2 + 2
    x + y
  end

outputs:

  x = (1 + 1)
  #=> 2
  y = (2 + 2)
  #=> 4
  (x + y)
  #=> 6

Easy. Fancy.

There are a few neat options to tweak the formatting. See the examples.rb file.
